## Problem
The previous site was outdated. It was cluttered with too much text, contained inconsistent messaging about the company and the technology they're building, and the Intercom chat feature was bringing in a large volume of low quality enquiries.

## Goal
The goal was to clearly communicate and inform potential customers on what the company does, the technology they're building, the value that technology can bring to customers, as well as provide information to investors. Additionally, to bring in high quality enquiries/leads for the sales team.

## Solution
Create a responsive website that provides clear and concise information to potential customers and investors.

## My Role
UX design and front-end development. I was responsible for creating the site map, medium fidelity mockups, prototype, the gathering of website copy and images, and front-end development of the website.

## Tools
Justinmind (mockups, prototype), Jekyll (static site generator), HTML & CSS, git

## Process

At the beginning of the website redesign, I conducted an interview with the CEO to determine the issues with the current site and to determine the goals for the new website. As a public facing company, I also needed to confirm requirements such as including the company's stock ticker, press releases, and investor information.

One of the problems with the site was that it was cluttered with too much text and diagrams. To address this, I wanted to keep only what was essential. I evaluated all the website copy and diagrams. Any copy that was conflicting or repetitive, and any diagrams that were unclear or overly complex were removed. To prevent low quality enquiries, the Intercom chat feature was also removed. If a potential customer or investor had questions for the company, they could forward their enquiries using the appropriate email addresses found on the "Contact Us" page. After doing some information architecture including a card sorting exercise, I created a site map and assigned the written content creation to the appropriate company members. I then created medium fidelity mockups and an interactive prototype. 

Using the prototype, I was able to present and communicate my ideas to management. I then received helpful feedback which I incorporated into the designs while building the website. 

After launch, further iterations were done to accommodate for updates to copy, services provided, and company branding.

## Outcome
The new website now contains consistent messaging on the company, the blockchain platform they're building, and the benefits their platform can bring to customers. Low quality enquiries also decreased substantially with the removal of the Intercom feature.

## Key Learnings
There was a fine balance that needed to be met with this project. Management had a lot of content they wanted to include on the website, but I needed to keep the information focused and concise so that users wouldn't get distracted or overwhelmed with too much information.
