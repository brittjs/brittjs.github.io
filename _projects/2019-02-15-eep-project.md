## Problem
When trading energy products, issues with record keeping and data management can lead to costly errors and wasted time. Data errors are caused by trade data being sent as PDF attachments via email, manual entry of data into gas balancing and portfolio management software, unaccounted for trade updates that lead to data discrepancies among counterparties, and manual searches through filed PDFs to find the latest trade updates. In addition, reconciling the amount of product that was sent versus what was actually received, can lead to delays for invoicing.

## Solution
Using BTL’s blockchain platform, BTL, BP, Eni, and Wien Energie undertook a twelve-week pilot to design and develop a blockchain-based product that could achieve trade-by-trade reconciliation. 

The project team understood that blockchain technology’s applicability extends across the range of back office processes, and is not limited to trade-by-trade reconciliation. This pilot was undertaken as a first step in demonstrating how blockchain technology can reshape processes throughout the entire back office.

## My Role
UX design

## Tools

Balsamiq (wireframes, prototype), Photoshop (medium-fidelity mockups)

## Process

All three participating energy companies were directly involved in co-creating a potential solution that would benefit all parties. This collaborative approach was chosen recognizing that each of the participants face similar risks and challenges in back office processing, despite any variations that may exist in scale and commodities traded. At the outset of the pilot, a kickoff meeting, regular collaborative meetings, and individual sessions were planned to gather functional requirements, identify data to be used, confirm user stories to be tested, and answer key questions about technology, security, privacy, and scalability. 

## Wireframes & Mockups

Once functional requirements were gathered, I worked collaboratively with BTL’s CTO, CIO, Project Manager, and the Head of Product Enablement to complete clickable wireframes for a real-time reconciliation dashboard that could demonstrate the eight user stories created for the pilot. 

#### Here are 5 of the 8 user stories:

</div>
**Simple Trade Match:** Demonstrating that trades with identical unique trade identifiers (UTIs) and attributes could be matched on the platform with the appropriate status shown on the dashboard.

</div>
**A ‘Hanging’ Trade:** Demonstrating that a trade that has been entered by only one party can be shown as _pending_ on the dashboard, and that the status is updated to _matched_ when the other party to the trade updates their side.

  <img src="/images/eep/user_story_3_slide_3.png">
</div>

**A Simple Mismatch - Amendment before Matching:** Demonstrating that two trades that match on UTI, but have an unmatched attribute, will maintain a _disputed_ status until the appropriate party to the trade alters and updates the disputed attribute, creating a match.

</div>

**A Complex Mismatch - Amendment before Matching requiring Communication and Multiple Amendments to Resolve:** Demonstrating (1) that two trades that match on UTI, but have multiple unmatched attributes, will maintain a disputed status until the appropriate party to the trade alters and updates the disputed attribute(s), and (2) that communication to resolve the dispute regarding the attribute(s) is possible via the blockchain rather than email, and that these messages can be exchanged multiple times until the dispute is resolved creating a match.

  <img src="/images/eep/user_story_5a_slide_3.png">
</div>

**Matched Trade is Unmatched and can be Rematched - Economic Amendment after Matching:** Demonstrating that a previously matched trade can be unmatched, attribute(s) can be disputed and resolved, and can result in a recreated match.

---

During the weekly meetings with the participants, the wireframes were presented and feedback was gathered. After a few weeks of iteration, the participants were satisfied with the clickable wireframes and the next step was to quickly create high-fidelity mockups.

All design materials were then handed over to the developer to be built.

## User Story Testing

All participating energy companies were given access to the application. During the execution of the user stories, the participants had the opportunity to access and test the platform’s functions, both with BTL and independently. The pilot application was successful in demonstrating all eight user stories.

## Outcome

The pilot successfully demonstrated that confirmations could be executed on a trade-by-trade basis using blockchain. This outcome provided evidence for the broader, transformative potential that blockchain technology promises to deliver across the range of back office activities that support trading operations within energy companies.

The success of the pilot led to OneOffice - the second phase of BTL’s European energy project, which included participants like Eni Trading & Shipping, Total, Gazprom Marketing & Trading Limited, Mercuria, Vattenfall, Petroineos and Freepoint to deliver cost savings across the trade life cycle.
