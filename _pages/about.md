## Hey there!

I’m a UX Designer from Surrey, BC with just under 3 years of experience in the tech industry. My experience includes working at a Vancouver blockchain startup where I worked on designing web applications and responsive websites. I have a passion for learning, collaborating with team members, understanding user behaviour, and wireframing & prototyping ideas to find the right solutions.

In my spare time I enjoy finding new recipes to try, watching movies, and spending time with family.
