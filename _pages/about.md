## Hey there!

I’m a UX/UI Designer from Surrey, BC with just under 3 years of experience in the tech industry. My experience includes working at a Vancouver blockchain start up where I worked on designing web applications and responsive websites. I have a passion for learning, wireframing & prototyping ideas, understanding user behaviour, and collaborating with team members. In my spare time I enjoy finding new recipes to try, watching movies, and spending time with family.
